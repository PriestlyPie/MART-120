I got a score of 54.00 out of 60.00 on the mindset quiz, which suggests a strong growth mindset.

My Scores:

Auditory: 30%
Visual: 35%
Tactile: 35%
I am a Visual/Tactile learner.

I do think learning styles affect how we learn - for example, if you're a tactile learner, learning from doing is easier than if an audio/visual learner tried the same thing. Conversely, an audio learner will learn quicker than a tactile learner from an audio textbook, etc etc.
