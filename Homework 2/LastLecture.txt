The biggest impact I believe that I shared with Pausch is his encouraging parents - growing up, my parents were the same way. "Follow your imagination," they would tell me. They still do, and I'm grateful for it. Frankly, I think the encouragement I received from my family growing up is a big reason as to why I'm going to college to get a degree in Game Design. I've been dreaming (similar to Pausch,) about being a game developer ever since I can remember, and being told constantly that that dream was achievable reinforced my passion for it. 
I think his point of focusing on the moment is very important, and I've taken to that throughout my life whenever I remember to. Appreciating life for what it is, and not the prospect of what it could be, is advice that I keep near and dear to me.
