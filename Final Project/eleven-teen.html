        <h1>Weeks 11, 12, & 14</h1>
        <p>The last three weeks of work involved creating a miniature game with</p>
        <p>JavaScript. It involves a player-controlled character moving to the exit.</p>
        <h5>For Week 12, we added functions for ease of repetition, and for Week 14</h5>
        <h5>we added arrays to allow for easier creation of several objects.</h5>
