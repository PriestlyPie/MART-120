        <h1>Weeks 6-8</h1>
        <p>For this clump of weeks, we took our first look at actually making</p>
        <p>our own websites. Our first goal was simply to make three basic pages:</p>
        <p>the first being a simple 'About Me' page, the second being a short story,</p>
        <p>and the third being a 'Contact Me' page.</p>

        <h5>Week 7 introduced the use of style sheets to give the website a more</h5>
        <h5>distinct look, and Week 8 involved the use of JavaScript for some</h5>
        <h5>basic form validation.</h5>
