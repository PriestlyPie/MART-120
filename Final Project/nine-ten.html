        <h1>Weeks 9 and 10</h1>
        <p>For these two weeks, we created a 'self-portrait' of ourselves</p>
        <p>using simple shapes and colors with p5.js, then were tasked with animating</p>
        <p>our 'selves' randomly with different speeds and directions and such.</p>
        <p>A fun project!</p>
