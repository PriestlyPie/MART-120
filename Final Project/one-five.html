        <h1>Week One</h1>
        <p>For our first week, we simply created our GitHub repositories. We used</p>
        <p>the repositories to showcase our work and to compile it all in one place sufficiently.</p>

        <h1>Week Two</h1>
        <p>During our second week, we created an art piece in the Artist Lab and</p>
        <p>did the Dance Party 'Hour of Code' activity - this helped us begin to</p>
        <p>see where exactly this class would be going.</p>

        <h1>Week Three</h1>
        <p>For the third week, we began to learn how to use Scratch - a visual</p>
        <p>coding interface for beginners to understand code. We were tasked with</p>
        <p>creating a story or game to present to our peers.</p>

        <h1>Week Four</h1>
        <p>Week Four introduced us to the Code Lab and Mobile Lab which showed us</p>
        <p>two different types of coding with visual aid. We were tasked with making</p>
        <p>a simple game within both applications.</p>

        <h1>Week Five</h1>
        <p>Week Five was rather unique - we made a simple animation or game in</p>
        <p>an application called Alice. It allows for 3D characters and stories,</p>
        <p>and is more versatile than the applications we've used so far. I created</p>
        <p>a simple animation about two sea snails and an evil bear.</p>
